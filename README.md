# Metasploit-vulnerability-assessment

vulnerability assessment  against metasploitable 2 by using nessus essentials on kali linux

Abstract :

This project focuses on performing a security assessment using the Nessus vulnerability scanner to detect security weaknesses within the Metasploitable 2 system. The scan uncovered multiple vulnerabilities including outdated software versions, weak configurations, and exploitable services. This report outlines the setup, execution, and results of the vulnerability scan. Providing insights into Nessus’s effectiveness as a vulnerability management tool.

Objectives:

Install and configure the Nessus vulnerability scanner on a host machine

Run an advanced audit scan on the Metasploitable 2 virtual machine

Identify, categorize, and analyze the vulnerabilities detected by Nessus

Evaluate the severity and potential impact of these vulnerabilities

Part I: Setup and Installation

This project began by setting up downloading and installing Nessus on the host machine. Metasploitable 2 was used as the target machine serving as a vulnerable system for testing purposes.

To start, Nessus was downloaded to run against Metasploitable 2.

Part II: Scanning Process

Once Nessus was successfully installed and initialized, the next step involved creating and running an advanced scan targeting Metasploitable 2.

A new Advanced Scan was created in Nessus, named “metasploitable 2 project,” with the IP address of the Metasploitable 2 machine specified as the target.

The scan was initiated, and Nessus proceeded to probe the target system for vulnerabilities. After the scan was completed Nessus generated a detailed report listing all identified vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is categorized by severity (critical, high, medium, low, and informational).

Part III: Results and Analysis

The Nessus scan against Metasploitable 2 revealed a variety of vulnerabilities across different severity levels The results were analyzed to assess the potential risks these vulnerabilities posed to the system.

Nessus categorized the vulnerabilities based on their severity, with each issue receiving a risk score. Critical vulnerabilities indicated high-risk exploits that could lead to a full system compromise, while lower severity findings highlighted weaker issues that might not pose an immediate threat.
